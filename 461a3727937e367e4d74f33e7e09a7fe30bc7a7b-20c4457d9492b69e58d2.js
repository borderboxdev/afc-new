I love the “community” feel of this facility. It's small, clean, and everyone is very friendly… even the other members. The membership is just one of the aspects that makes this experience different - it's a combination of professionals and athletes. No steroid heads here!  The staff is unbelievably highly qualified from exercise physiologists to health coaches.  They are an amazing group of professionals. I have scoliosis and some other physical health limitations.  The  care they provided me from the initial consultation and evaluation to the individualized program to accommodate my limitations while improving my range of motion and strength has changed my life. I work with a trainer twice a week and, in doing so, have seen such improvement that it's changed my life. I'm not exaggerating. I no longer wake up and endure the day with back pain. (And understand that I'm married to a chiropractor. But if you don't do the work to support musculoskeletal structure,  you won't improve.) I'm much more flexible and I'm able to enjoy more activities without “paying for it” afterwards. AFC is a blessing for me. I can't imagine my life without this amazing group of people. They have created a warm and welcoming environment here that I so thoroughly enjoy.",createTime:"2022-22-10T15:01:23Z",updateTime:"",reviewReply:{comment:"Wow, thank you Judi!",updateTime:""}},{name:"dasdfasdfasd",reviewId:"sdfasdfasdf",reviewer:{profilePhotoUrl:"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCmV2fz-ihQCT5M002IEWvcnYcBB1YxVkN2QF0srfg=w72-h72-p-c0x00000000-rp-mo-ba2-br100",displayName:"Elizabeth Cole",isAnonymous:!1},starRating:"FIVE",comment:"I would like to commend Collin McGee.

He knew exactly what was wrong after that and gave me detailed exercises WITH instruction on how to do them properly to address my specific problem. I have never had anyone show me exactly what to do for my specific injury. His assistance was SO appreciated!!! You have no idea. I've been to doctors, chiropractors, physical therapists and no one gave me exactly what I needed. Collin McGee did! It was the best $200 I ever spent. I look forward to a follow-up evaluation at a later date.",createTime:"2022-22-10T15:01:23Z",updateTime:"",reviewReply:{comment:"Beth, this is terrific to hear!
