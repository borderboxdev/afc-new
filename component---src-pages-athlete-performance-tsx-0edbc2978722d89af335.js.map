Performance and injury mitigation are individual to each athlete. Each athlete presents a different athletic history, different body types, and a different set of strengths and weaknesses. Assessing all of these prior to training is the ONLY way to see these and create training programs that reflect these findings. An athleteâ€™s training should reflect their humanness, their sports, and translate to those specific gains. Having accurate and reliable means of testing and assessing all that goes into ensuring those qualities is the key to successful exercise program creation and long-term athlete management.\n                    </p>\n                </header>\n\n                <section>\n                   CARDS GOES HERE\n                </section>\n            </main>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default AthletePerformance"],"names":["React","className"],"sourceRoot":""}
