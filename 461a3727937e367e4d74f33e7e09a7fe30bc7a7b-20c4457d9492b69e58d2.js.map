The  care they provided me from the initial consultation and evaluation to the individualized program to accommodate my limitations while improving my range of motion and strength has changed my life. I work with a trainer twice a week and, in doing so, have seen such improvement that it's changed my life. I'm not exaggerating. I no longer wake up and endure the day with back pain. (And understand that I'm married to a chiropractor. But if you don't do the work to support musculoskeletal structure,  you won't improve.)

All of the group fitness classes make you feel like the trainer is working with you individually.  They are supportive towards your goals and try to push you to be stronger than you thought you could be.\n    The gym focuses on building strength for a better body.  The staff is encouraging and helps you to see the bigger picture of fitness (keeping your body healthy and not focusing on the scale).`,\n    // A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC \"Zulu\" format, with nanosecond resolution and up to nine fractional digits.\n    \"createTime\": '2022-22-10T15:01:23Z',\n    // The timestamp for when the review was last modified.\n    \"updateTime\": '',\n    // object (ReviewReply) The owner/manager of this location's reply to this review.\n    \"reviewReply\": {\n      // The body of the reply as plain text with markups.

I tried PF and a couple others with friends but was always so nervous about all the people and I had NO idea how to use the equipment.\n    I started at AFC almost 2 years ago with an InBody challenge. They offered beginners classes where they broke down different exercises and went at a nice pace for someone, like me, who was completely new to the gym space and exercising.\n    Every single trainer and staff person who works there is super nice, welcoming, helpful, and encouraging! I was able to get into a nice routine with classes and, for the first time in my life, was able to get into an exercise routine.\n    They handled COVID so well and still offered Zoom classes which were nice to do at home without having any equipment.\n    I started training with Faith Elliot a couple weeks ago and it was the best decision I’ve made!\n    You won’t regret giving it a shot!`,\n    // A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC \"Zulu\" format, with nanosecond resolution and up to nine fractional digits.\n    \"createTime\": '2022-22-10T15:01:23Z',\n    // The timestamp for when the review was last modified.\n    \"updateTime\": '',\n    // object (ReviewReply) The owner/manager of this location's reply to this review.\n    \"reviewReply\": {\n      // The body of the reply as plain text with markups.
